# How to Save Your BEAN Logo

## Steps to Add Your Logo:

1. **Right-click on the BEAN logo image** in your chat and select "Save image as..."

2. **Save it with these exact settings:**
   - File name: `bean-logo.png`
   - Location: `C:\Users\nagar\OneDrive\Desktop\project_3\E-Commerce_Analytics_Platform-main\project_3\client\src\assets\bean-logo.png`
   - Format: PNG

3. **Verify the file is saved correctly:**
   - Navigate to `client\src\assets\` folder
   - You should see `bean-logo.png` alongside other images (bhargavi.png, eeswar.png, abdul.png, nagaraju.png)

4. **Rebuild and restart your application:**
   ```powershell
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

5. **Your new logo will appear in:**
   - Top navigation bar (left side)
   - All pages where the brand logo is displayed

## Already Updated:
✅ Navigation bar code updated to use image logo
✅ CSS styling added for the logo
✅ Team member names (Bhargavi, Eeswar, Abdul, Nagaraju) are correct
✅ Brand name "BEAN Analytics" is displayed correctly

## If the logo doesn't show:
- Make sure the file name is exactly `bean-logo.png` (lowercase)
- Check the file is in the correct folder
- Restart the development server
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
